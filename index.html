      Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I
      personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple
      Computer, Inc. in 1977 and the company's next computer, the Apple II,
      became a best seller. Apple went public in 1980, to instant financial
      success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical
      user interfaces, including the original Macintosh, announced in a
      critically acclaimed advertisement, "1984", directed by Ridley Scott. By
      1985, the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives
      caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably and pursued
      other ventures, while Jobs resigned bitterly and founded NeXT, taking some
      Apple employees with him.

      founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell
      BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal

      increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made a
      number of corporate acquisitions, their largest being the acquisition of
      LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016, followed by their acquisition
      of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011.
